It highlights microgravity as a critical condition influencing bone health, cellular processes, and potential therapeutic applications. Microgravity is shown to cause bone loss through increased osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition mediated by CDKN1a/p21, while decreasing Trp53. It significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting T cell activation and macrophage differentiation, leading to impaired human health. Conversely, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration and stem cell differentiation by modulating pathways like Hippo and PI3K-Akt, and promotes spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells. When combined with materials like polystyrene and collagen microspheres, microgravity culture preserves stemness and improves proliferation, colony, and network formation in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), enhancing regenerative therapies. It also increases the expression of pluripotent markers like OCT4 and SOX2 in hASCs. Cardiomyocytes show enhanced function under microgravity. These diverse effects underscore microgravity's dual implications for space medicine and terrestrial health, affecting both detrimental processes like bone loss and beneficial applications in regenerative medicine.",2024-05-30,Unified Scientific Review,Article
